# UberDash
Legacy UberDash repo for Windows Interactive Desktop Background.

This is an old archive of a project I started as a student in 2004. 
It replaces the Windows Desktop with an OpenGL context and pluggable extensions 
for animated Desktop effects. It was first developed under XP and tested through 
Windows 8. This project took a lot of time back in the day and ended up migrated 
from C++ to C# v2.0.

Prior to release, Microsoft announced Windows Dreamscene in Vista. 
I came across an old archive of the source and decided to post it for archival.
